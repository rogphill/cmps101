Q1: 2.75 Outer loop should run to n, combined is n(n-1). Induction step is
         incomplete. You can't assume everything in A[(n-k+1) .. n] is sorted
         from assuming k. Use bubble sort algorithm to prove. 
Q2: 0.5 Induction proof is incorrect. Try assuming the base case and explain what happens when you add the n+1 to it. (How does the number of odd and even subsets vary?)
Q3: 2
Q4: 2
Q5: 1 Requires further observations. Look into invariants or induction.
